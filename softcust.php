							    Do you have a software or an application which is very good but still somehow doesn't have all the features that you need or requires some tweaking here and there? No worries. We can help you with that. Simply let us know about your software or application, which features you wish to add, edit or remove and we will customize it exactly the way you want it and in alignment with your project needs.
								<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								Software customizations can span the entire project life cycle if need be and is strongly driven by customer request. Customizations mainly involve changing existing functions and maintenance processes as well as creating entirely new modules for the application.
								<br><br>
								
								Here is how it works...<br><br>
								
								
								1. You have a software or an application that you purchased thinking it has all or if not most of the featues that you desire.<br><br>
								
								
								2. Over the time as you are using the product, you realize that some features are missing and it would be great to have them added. Alternatively you may feel there are too many features and it would be nice to have some features removed. And all this without breaking the existing functionality. <br><br>
								
								
								3. You can then contact Incredible and we will analyse your requirements. Our engineers and system analysts will work closely with with you to iron out the business logic behind the changes that need to be made or new application modules that need to be added if any. Much consulting work is done during the software customization process. We believe this is a collaborative effort.<br><br>
								
								
								4. Once the feasibility study is over and you give us the approval to begin, our programmers will be ready to tailor-make your software as per your requirements.<br><br>
								
								
								5. Once the job is done, the application will be thoroughly tested to make sure the integrity of the application is maintained.<br><br>
								
								
								6. You are now ready to use the software just the way you had envisioned and wanted it to be.<br><br>
								
								
								<b>Please note that it is important that you have the source code of the software or application you want to customize.</b><br><br>
