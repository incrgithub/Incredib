								<b>3. Static HTML Websites</b><br><br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								To gain advantage in the current competitive world, all organizations prefer to have a website online where they can explain more about their company. If you wish to provide information only about your organization and its activities and do not wish to have any user interaction then you should go in for a static website. It can best be described as an informative site. A static website plays a major role in its visitor's choice to either stick around or continue surfing. Elements such as graphics, layout, load time, fonts and ease of navigation influence the visitor. By integrating highly proficient analysts, search engine optimization experts, and innovative graphic designers, iProgrammer will be happy to develop your powerful static website.
